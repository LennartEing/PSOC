# PSOC
A program that uses Particle Swarm Optimization to optimize standard benchmarkfunctions and distributes the execution of single particles over an adjustable amount of threads. (Originally used for runtime-testing.)

This program is something i built a while back to test optimize the distribution of particles per core.
Unfortunately this went rather... unsuccessful due to not understanding how to properly use threadpools back then.
Snippets of this program could be used to implement multicore pso in Java, big parts of it are benchmarkfunctions and such.
For this the code would have to be cleaned up allround though, and I'm really sorry for anyone trying to understand the code, 
I didn't really know how to do all this back then.
